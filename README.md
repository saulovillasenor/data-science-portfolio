# Exploratory Data Analysis on US Accidents Dataset
In this notebook I will talk about Exploratory Data Analysis in general and about this US accidents dataset in particular. I will get some information about the dataset to analyse it and build some representations and by the end some conclusions will be drawn from it. The aim of this repository is to briefly show my experience in working with data.

The dataset is provided by Moosavi et. al. (2019) and was downloaded from the following Kaggle's link: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
